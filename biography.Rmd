### Biography

I am a Senior Data Analyst at Hawaiian Airlines within the Crew Resource Planning team, where I identify and address inefficiencies by leveraging my data science expertise. I specialize in aggregating complex bronze-tier data sources to produce valuable silver and gold-tier data sets that drive informed decision-making.

Prior to this role, I served as the Data Manager and Data Architect at Rincon Consultants, delivering data solutions that enhanced workflow efficiencies for both internal and external clients. From 2022 to 2024, I contributed to the Resilience Institute Bridging Biological Training and Research (RIBBiTR) as the Data Manager by facilitating research on emerging infectious diseases affecting amphibians.

My journey in data science began with a Master's degree in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I also hold a B.S. in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology from the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Before transitioning into data science, I gained extensive field experience conducting kelp forest surveys at the Northern Channel Islands for the Partnership of Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) from 2017 to 2021. Additionally, I worked with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) under the Pelagic Fisheries and Ecosystem Project as a squid fishery dock sampler.

Throughout my career, I have developed a strong proficiency in analyzing and aggregating large datasets, recognizing the critical role of advanced statistical analysis and effective data management. I am passionate about uncovering insights hidden within complex data and aligning all the pieces to present a clear and actionable narrative.
