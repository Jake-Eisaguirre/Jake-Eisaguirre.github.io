I graduated in 2019 from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology. Since 2017, I have been conducting kelp forest surveys at the Northern Channel Islands for the Partnership of Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO). During my time with PISCO, I began learning the proper tools needed for the analysis of large ecological data sets. I quickly understood the power and importance behind using advanced statistical analysis and computer software to answer ecological questions. My field seasons with PISCO has re-enforced a connection with our natural world that drives me to answer the unknowns. I have plans to apply my Data Science skills to the ecological world to uncover meaningful tools that can be used to conserve and restore our natural resources.\n            \n            \n              I am an experienced kelp forest field technician who is a first year Data Science Masters student at Bren School of Environmental Science and Management graduate school.
