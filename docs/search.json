I graduated in 2019 from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a B.S. in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology. Since 2017, I have been conducting kelp forest surveys at the Northern Channel Islands for the Partnership of Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO). I have also worked for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) under the Pelagic Fisheries and Ecosystem Project as a squid fishery dock sampler. During my time with PISCO and CDFW, I began learning the proper tools needed to analyze large ecological data sets. I quickly understood the power and importance of using advanced statistical analysis and computer software to answer ecological questions. My field seasons with PISCO have reinforced a connection with our natural world that drives me to answer the unknowns within our ecosystems. I have life goals to apply my Data Science skills to the ecological world to uncover meaningful tools that will be used to conserve and restore our natural resources.\n            \n            \n            Education\n            Master of Environmental Data Science\n            Bren School of Environmental Science & Management - Santa Barbara, California (2022)\n            Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (B.S.)\n            University of California, Santa Barbara - Santa Barbara, California (2019)\n            \n            \n            Experience\n            Research Technician - Caselle lab/PISCO, Marine Science Institute, UCSB (2016-2021)\n            Scientific Aid - Pelagic Fisheries and Ecosystem Project, California Department of Fish and Wildlife (2019–2020)\n            UC Reserve Steward - Kenneth Norris Rancho Marino UC Reserve,UC Natural Reserve System (2019–2020)\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Jake Eisaguirre\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Bren Profile\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Biography\n              I am an experienced kelp forest field technician who is a first-year Data Science Master student at The Bren School of Environmental Science and Management.
