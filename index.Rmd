Welcome, I am currently the Data Manager for the Resilience Institute Bridging Biological Training and Research ([RIBBiTR](https://ribbitr.com/)) aiding in the understanding of a fungal pathogen that has globally decimated amphibian populations. I am currently located at the National Center of Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)) in Santa Barbara, California.
