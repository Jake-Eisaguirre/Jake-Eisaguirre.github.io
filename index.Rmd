### Biography                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
I am the Data Manager for the Resilience Institute Bridging Biological Training and Research ([RIBBiTR](https://ribbitr.com/)) aiding in the understanding of emerging infectious amphibian diseases. Prior to my current position I completed a Masters in Environmental Data Science from The Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I received my undergraduate degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a B.S. in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology. From 2017 to 2021, I conducted kelp forest surveys at the Northern Channel Islands for the Partnership of Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans ([PISCO](https://www.piscoweb.org/)). I have also worked for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) under the Pelagic Fisheries and Ecosystem Project as a squid fishery dock sampler. During my time at Bren, I began learning the proper tools needed to analyze large ecological data sets. I quickly understood the power and importance of using advanced statistical analysis and computer software to answer ecological questions. My field seasons with PISCO have reinforced a connection with our natural world that drives me to answer the unknowns within our ecosystems. I have life goals to apply my Data Science skills to the ecological world to uncover meaningful tools that will be used to conserve and restore our natural resources.
